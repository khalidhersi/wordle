Wordle Clone
==========================

## About This App
Ive used  React JS, SCSs to create this Single Page Web Application of a working Wordle Clone.
The Game is fully functioning using react states to change the innerHTML of each grid, using the on-screen keyboard.
depending on how close you are to the correct word the background color of each grid will change to clue you in.
Green - for the correct letter in the correct place
Yellow- for the correct letter in an cinorrect place
Grey - for an incorrect letter in an cinorrect place

Within this Project I've showcased my React skills in varius way:
* State Hook is used throughout webpage
* UseEffect Hook is used to update Timer
* React Routing in App.jsx.

Future Plnas
-------------
* Adding a Backend to implement a leaderboard capability
* hosting this website on the cloud for anyone to visit and play
* fixing reset button disapearing when no letters are on the board --- Bug
